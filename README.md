# server-core


## Publishing

To publish a new version of this module,

- *do not* up-version on your development branch
- merge your fixes into `master`
- from the `master` branch,

```
yarn version --patch  # or whatever is suitable
```

As a follow-up,

- `package.json` is up-versioned
- a semver-ish tag is pushed to Git
- CircleCI will perform the `yarn publish` operation when it detects the tag
- it's ready once the 'versions' in `yarn info @withjoy/server-core` have been updated


## Integrating Before You Publish

Please see [Developing Node Modules](https://withjoy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KNOW/pages/1545896147/Developing+Node+Modules).


## Node 6 Support

> NOTE:  CircleCI runs the Test Suites for both Engines.

If you want a feature to be exposed to `app-server-api`, it must be compatible with the Node 6 engine.

The `require` syntax for Node 6 compatible features is:

```javascript
const { ... } = require("@withjoy/server-core/dist/node6");
```

### What To Do

You only need to worry about dealing with Node 6 Support when you're going to expose a new version to `app-server-api`.
As long as the monorepo doesn't upgrade its version, you can pretend that Node 6 Support *isn't there*.

Make sure to keep these files in-sync:

- `src/node6`, for selective exports
- `mocha-node6.opts`, for their matching Test Suite coverage

And here's the basic process:

```bash
# fresh clone of the repo
#   so as not to conflict with Node 10's installed `node_modules`
git clone git@github.com:joylifeinc/server-core.git
cd server-core

nvm use 6  # ... obviously

# install Node 6 modules, then rebuild the source & `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
npm install
npm run node6:build

# or, when you're forced to update the shrinkwrap,
npm run node6:build:relock

# build & run the Test Suite
npm run node6:test:build
npm run node6:test:run
```

And once it's all passing,

- commit the new `npm-shrinkwrap.json` (etc.)
- push your changes
- version + publish from within Node 10

### Build Tooling

It's somewhat fragile;

- we are using both `npm` and `yarn` in Node 6
  - yes, the same version of `yarn` that we use in Node 10
- the Node 10 version of `jest` won't launch in Node 6
  - so we use `mocha` + `chai`
  - `mocha@5`, because
    - there's no `@types/mocha@6`
    - `mocha@6` doesn't run on Node 6 (for the same reason as `jest`)
  - and we compile with `jest`s global DSL (`describe`, etc.) because it's identical to `mocha`s
- we use `tsc` to build / transpile in Node 6
  - we publish the **Node 10 transpiled versions**, which work fine in Node 6
  - however, the *Test Suite* is written in TypeScript, and it is *not* built as part of `dist/*` --
    instead, it transpiles into `build/*`, which is *not* "dist"ributed
- the `npm-shrinkwrap.json` generated from Node 10 depencies cannot be installed in Node 6
  - so it has to be re-built from within the Node 6 engine

These files are related, but won't change often (if ever)

- `tsconfig.node6-test.json`
- `.circleci/config.yml`


## CircleCI

Its Project uses the following Environment Variables:

- NPM_TOKEN, which must have Publish rights
